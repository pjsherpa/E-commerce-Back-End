### Project Description:

The e-commerce-back-end was built to demonstarte GET,POST,PUT & DELETE routes to return all categories, all products, and all tags being tested in Insomnia Core.

How it works?

1. Create database using mysql.
2. Created table and insert value accordinly.
3. Working with PUT,DELETE,POST & GET.
4. Once the above command has been put through in the current working app which is insomnia it will retreive/respond data accordingly.
5. One thing we will notice when we request GET we will notice a linkage between all three tables that had been created using step 2.
